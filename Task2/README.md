# Jekyll

**Beautiful Jekyll** is a ready-to-use template to help you create an awesome website quickly. Perfect for personal sites, blogs, or simple project websites.  [Check out a demo](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) of what you'll get after just two minutes.  You can also look at [my personal website](https://deanattali.com) to see it in use, or see examples of websites other people created using this theme [here](#showcased-users-success-stories).


## Prerequisites

- You need to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://github.com/join) - it takes one minute. This is where your website will live - if you sign up with username `derek` then your website will be `https://derek.github.io`.
- It would be helpful to understand what Markdown is and how to write it. Markdown is just a way to take a piece of text and format it to look a little nicer.  For example, this whole instruction set that you're reading is written in markdown - it's just text with some words being bold/larger/italicized/etc. I recommend taking 5 minutes to learn markdown [with this amazingly easy yet useful tutorial](https://markdowntutorial.com/).

## Build your website in 3 steps

Getting started is *literally* as easy as 1-2-3 :smile:
Scroll down to see the steps involved, but here is a 40-second video just as a reference as you work through the steps.

![Installation steps](install-steps.gif)

### 1. Fork this repository

(Assuming you are on this page and logged into GitHub) Fork this repository by clicking the *Fork* button on the top right corner. Forking means that you now copied this whole project and all the files into your account.

### 2. Rename the repository to `<yourusername>.github.io`

This will create a GitHub User page ready with the **Beautiful Jekyll** template that will be available at `https://<yourusername>.github.io` within a couple minutes.  To do this, click on *Settings* at the top (the cog icon) and there you'll have an option to rename.

### 3. Customize your website settings

Edit the `_config.yml` file to change all the settings to reflect your site. To edit the file, click on it and then click on the pencil icon (watch the video tutorial above if you're confused).  The settings in the file are fairly self-explanatory and I added comments inside the file to help you further. Any line that begins with a pound sign (`#`) is a comment, and the rest of the lines are actual settings.

Another way to edit the config file (or any other file) is to use [prose.io](https://prose.io/), which is just a simple interface to allow you to more intuitively edit files or add new files to your project.

After you save your changes to the config file (by clicking on *Commit changes* as the video tutorial shows), your website should be ready in a minute or two at `https://<yourusername>.github.io`. Every time you make a change to any file, your website will get rebuilt and should be updated in about a minute or so.

You can now visit your shiny new website, which will be seeded with several sample blog posts and a couple other pages. Your website is at `https://<yourusername>.github.io` (replace `<yourusername>` with your user name). Do not add `www` to the URL - it will not work!

## Above Steps are optional if you have followed [Task-1](https://github.com/helios1101/HacktoberFest_19/edit/master/Task1) 

## Add your own content

To add pages to your site, you can either write a markdown file (`.md`) or you can write an HTML file directly.  It is much easier to write markdown than HTML, so I suggest you do that (use the [tutorial I mentioned above](https://markdowntutorial.com/) if you need to learn markdown). You can look at some files on this site to get an idea of how to write markdown. To look at existing files, click on any file that ends in `.md`, for example [`aboutme.md`](./aboutme.md). On the next page you can see some nicely formatted text (there is a word in bold, a link, bullet points), and if you click on the pencil icon to edit the file, you will see the markdown that generated the pretty text. Very easy!

In contrast, look at [`index.html`](./index.html). That's how your write HTML - not as pretty. So stick with markdown if you don't know HTML.


## Final but Important Steps

1. In the repository there is a file `Contributors.md`.
2. You need to simply add your `Name` and `your github page link` adjacent to it and create a pull request.
(Make sure you're ading only two fields in the `contributors.md` file)
3. Send a PR with `Task-2-yourUserName` and wait for it to get merged. We'll be accepting your pull request as soon as possible!  

## Kudos!!
You've successfully made a beautiful looking website for yourself and have learnt Git and GitHub upto a good level.
